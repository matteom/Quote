# An example of the core concepts of iOS development

This app is meant to be an example of the core concepts needed to develop iOS apps. It is a simple two screen app that presents your favorite quote on screen and allows you to edit it. The quote is also saved to disk using iOS keyed archiving.

**Although simple, the app covers the following concepts of iOS development:**

* the MVC pattern and model controllers
* view controllers and their lifecycle
* the view hierarchy
* storyboards
* basics of Auto Layout
* outlets and the target-action pattern
* view controller containers
* communication between view controllers and delegation

[**A full explanation of how the app is built can be found here.**](http://matteomanferdini.com/understanding-the-core-architectural-principles-of-ios-development-with-a-practical-example/)
